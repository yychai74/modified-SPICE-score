# modified-SPICE-score

This repo is a modified version of [Semantic Propositional Image Caption Evaluation (SPICE)](https://github.com/peteanderson80/SPICE), which is designed for experiments in the paper [FACTUAL: A Benchmark for Faithful and Consistent Textual Scene Graph Parsing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17497.pdf) (ACL 2023).

You can obtain following result file using this code:

1. SPICE parser (Stanford scene graph parser) results.

2. SPICE score of customized scene graph.

Note: this implementation is easy and *extremely inelegant*.
